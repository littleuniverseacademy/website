        <p>Music is taught by Siyu Pan. She is a mezzo-soprano who graduated from Nanjing Normal University with a bachelor's degree in music education, a double master's degree (vocal performance and music education) and a diploma in vocal performance from the Bard Longy Conservatory of Music in the United States. In 2019, she was invited to participate in the Cremona Music Festival in Italy and successfully participated in many vocal ensemble concerts.

        <p>Art is taught by Jianyi Gu. Ms. Gu graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts of Tsinghua University and she also has a degree from ESMOD·Beijing. she teaches at a top Academy of Fine Arts. "Art is not only a painting technique, but also the observation and perception of life, the experience and expression of life, and the collision of sensibility and logic." Therefore, Ms. Gu’s cultivating attitude is that thinking is more important than technology, and it is brought about by the need to express creativity. In the learning process, children should not pay too much attention to technology and imitation skills just to obtain picture effects, but should give enough space for children to express their ideas. In the picture effect, the original ecological effect of children's painting is also preserved as much as possible to protect their natural artistic sense and innocence.</p>

        <p><strong>Flexibility in camp schedule and combination:</strong> Our summer camp program offers ample resiliency in selection and designation. You can choose the morning program only or the afternoon program only; you can combine the morning with noon or noon with the afternoon; you can also choose the whole day. You can choose a one-week, two-week or three-week schedule. Since July and August programs have the same content, you can also align your attendance in any combination.
            For example, if you are only interested in learning Karate, you can choose the karate morning alone.</p>

        <p>Art is taught by Jianyi Gu. Ms. Gu graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts of Tsinghua University and she also has a degree from ESMOD·Beijing. she teaches at a top Academy of Fine Arts. "Art is not only a painting technique, but also the observation and perception of life, the experience and expression of life, and the collision of sensibility and logic." Therefore, Ms. Gu’s cultivating attitude is that thinking is more important than technology, and it is brought about by the need to express creativity. In the learning process, children should not pay too much attention to technology and imitation skills just to obtain picture effects, but should give enough space for children to express their ideas. In the picture effect, the original ecological effect of children's painting is also preserved as much as possible to protect their natural artistic sense and innocence.</p>

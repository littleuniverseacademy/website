        <h2>The budding beauty - children's creative art class
        </h2>
        <p>Ms. Gu: Graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts of Tsinghua University
            Graduated from ESMOD·Beijing in 2009
            Taught at a top Academy of Fine Arts</p>
            <br>
        <p>"Art is not only a painting technique, but also the observation and perception of life, the experience and expression of life, and the collision of sensibility and logic." Therefore, our cultivating attitude is that thinking is more important than technology, and it is brought about by the need to express creativity. In the learning process, children should not pay too much attention to technology and imitation skills just to obtain picture effects, but should give enough space for children to express their ideas. In the picture effect, the original ecological effect of children's painting is also preserved as much as possible to protect their natural artistic sense and innocence.
